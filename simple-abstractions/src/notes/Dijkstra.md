- instead of infinite, could just have "not related"
- encoding `_<=_+_` add as a (primite or not) relation 
  - how far can you go with just using relations?
  - can just use Z/S for building up Nats
- generic programming for building type of expressions over a data/relation
- need to annotated rules with which free variables to fill in first 
  - which index to lookup missing hypotheses from
